# 🌍 Air Quality & Public Health Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes the impact of air pollution (PM2.5 and PM10) on global respiratory health outcomes and healthcare spending. This project combines datasets from WHO and OWID to provide insights into pollution trends, mortality rates, and public health infrastructure across countries.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is organized into three main sections:
1. **Air Quality Trends**  
   - Daily PM2.5 levels across major cities  
   - Top cities by average PM10 concentration  
   - Air quality categories and country-wise comparisons

2. **Health Impact Analysis**  
   - Correlation between PM2.5 pollution and respiratory deaths  
   - Country-wise breakdown of average respiratory mortality  
   - Time-series trends in healthcare expenditure and pollution severity

3. **Strategic Summary & Recommendations**  
   - Summary KPIs: Avg. Resp. Deaths, Max PM2.5, Avg. Health Expenditure  
   - Distribution of air quality categories  
   - Health risks by pollution severity across nations

## 💡 Key Insights

- Countries with consistently high PM2.5 levels tend to show elevated respiratory mortality.
- Investment in healthcare does not always correlate with low respiratory death rates, highlighting the importance of environmental policies.
- Visual analytics provide a strategic layer to identify high-risk regions and inform policy decisions.
